<p class="Personal"> My circle of friend consist mostly of my teammates in Basketball, especially in my Junior MPBL team, me and all of my teammates there have been together for almost a year straight now, you could even say that we are like brothers, because through thick and thin we are always together, on one court, as one team, with the same goal. I don't socialize much outside of my home but In the 3 years I have spent in LPSCI, I could say that I have made quite a lot of friends, but this is only natural, because I will be with my classmates till the end of the school year and even until the graduation of grade 12, I will be with them in many more events like the VPOP, further strengthening our bond. There is one friend I consider most to be my best friend and it is Seth, I am very confident when he is around, he boosts my mood and lifts up my spirit every time I feel down. </p>

<p class="Personal">My family is the most important thing in my life. Whenever we're together, I feel true happiness and love. The memories we create, the laughter we share, and the stories we tell are the things that strengthen me.

My parents are the pillars of our family. They provide me with genuine love, support, and guidance. My sister is my friend and partner in adventure. We help and love each other

Whenever we're together, I feel true happiness. We have bonding moments, laughter, and conversations. These memories are the things that strengthen me and make me happy.

My family is my strength and inspiration. They are the people who truly loves me. I'm grateful to God for having a wonderful family like them.</p>
