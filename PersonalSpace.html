  <p>My circle of friends consists mostly of my teammates in basketball, especially in my Junior MPBL team. We’ve been together for almost a year straight now — like brothers. Even through thick and thin, we are always together, on one court, with the same goal.</p>

  <h1>My Family</h1>

  <p>My family is the most important thing in my life. Whenever we're together, I feel true happiness and love. The memories we create and the laughter we share strengthen me every day. I'm grateful to God for giving me a wonderful family like them.</p>
