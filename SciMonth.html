    <h3>What is the most important thing I learned from the event?</h3>
    <p>
      I learned a lot about science—the terms, definitions, and how to cooperate with my teammates in creating a research plan from scratch within a limited time. I learned how to work under pressure and make the most of every opportunity given to me.
    </p>

    <h3>How can I apply what I have learned in real-life situations?</h3>
    <p>
      I can apply this in real life through the knowledge I gained about science and research. I now understand how things work and why they happen. Creating a research plan under time pressure taught me to think faster, generate innovative ideas, and improve based on feedback from panelists.
    </p>

    <h3>Did I actively participate in the event? How?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, I participated in this event as the representative of my section in both the Stemazing competition and the Science Quiz Bee.
    </p>

    <h3>If I were to teach this topic or subject to a classmate, how would I explain it?</h3>
    <p>
      I would explain what happens during Science Month, why it’s important, how to create a research plan, and what it feels like to participate in scientific events.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it important to have an event (per subject)? Explain your answer.</h3>
    <p>
      It is important to have an event in Science because it helps us understand how the world works. Science explains why things happen and sparks curiosity. It is especially important in a Science High School where innovation and discovery are valued.
