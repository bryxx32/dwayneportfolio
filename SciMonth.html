<h1> Science Month </h1>

<h3>What is the most important thing I learned from the event? </h3> <br>
<p>
I learned alot about science, the terms, the definitions, and how to cooperate with my teammates in research on creating a research plan from scratch with only limited time, i learned how to work under pressure and to maximize every opportunity given to me.
</p><br>

<h3> How can I apply what i have learned in real life situations? </h3> <br>
<p>
I can apply this in real-life because of the terms i have learned and their definitions, i can now know how things happen in life and how science is so complex, I now have knowledge about how to make a research plan under time pressure and that has teached me to think of more innovative ideas and to think faster, and with the suggestions of the panelists to my teams research, I have also learned what are the things that i have to change in what I do in research and what I must not do
</p><br>

<h3> Did I actively participate in the event? How? </h3> <br>
<p>
I participated in this event, because I was the representative of my section in the stemazing and in the science quiz bee.
</p><br>

<h3> If i were to teach this topic/subject to a classmate, how would I explain it? </h3> <br>
<p>
I will teach this by explaining what happens in the events and why it is important to be held, on how to make a research plan, and what it feels like to be in one of these events.
</p><br>

<h3> Why is it important to have an event (per subject)? Explain your answer. </h3> <br>
<p> 
It is important to have an event in Science because Science is one of the most important in life, it explains how the things in life happen and why they are so interesting this is also important especially because we study in a Science High School.
