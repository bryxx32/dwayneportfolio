<h1> AP Month </h1>

<h3>What is the most important thing I learned from the event? </h3> <br>
<p>
The most important thing I learned from the event is all about population development, the law in taking care of reproductive health and the measures to regulating population growth.
</p><br>

<h3> How can I apply what i have learned in real life situations? </h3> <br>
<p>
Because I am more aware now of population development, i will contribute knowledge to other people on why it is important to control population growth.
</p><br>

<h3> Did I actively participate in the event? How? </h3> <br>
<p>
No, I only took the classroom elimination quiz bee but besides that, I did not do much in this Event.
</p><br>

<h3> If i were to teach this topic/subject to a classmate, how would I explain it? </h3> <br>
<p>
I would explain this by telling my classmate about all the things that take place within the AP month and what population development is, why it is important in our lives, and what are the things done in order to stabilize population growth and mortality rates.
</p><br>

<h3> Why is it important to have an event (per subject)? Explain your answer. </h3> <br>
<p> 
It is important for the AP subject to have an event like this because it lets us learn more about social studies and all about the continent and the country that our section is representing.
