    <h3>What is the most important thing I learned from the event?</h3>
    <p>
      The most important thing I learned from the event is all about population development, the laws for taking care of reproductive health, and the measures to regulate population growth.
    </p>

    <h3>How can I apply what I have learned in real-life situations?</h3>
    <p>
      Because I am more aware now of population development, I will share my knowledge with others about why it is important to control population growth.
    </p>

    <h3>Did I actively participate in the event? How?</h3>
    <p>
      No, I only took the classroom elimination quiz bee, but besides that, I did not do much in this event.
    </p>

    <h3>If I were to teach this topic/subject to a classmate, how would I explain it?</h3>
    <p>
      I would explain this by telling my classmate about everything that takes place during AP Month â€” what population development is, why it is important, and what steps are taken to stabilize population growth and mortality rates.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it important to have an event (per subject)? Explain your answer.</h3>
    <p>
      It is important for the AP subject to have an event like this because it allows us to learn more about social studies and understand the continents and countries our section represents.
