    <h3>Why is it important to have an event (per subject)? Explain your answer.</h3>
    <p>
      It is important to have a Filipino subject event because we are Filipinos, and these events teach us to love our country, appreciate our culture, and understand our history. They encourage students to engage in cultural activities and apply what they learn in daily life.
